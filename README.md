# ltreesitter

Tree sitter bindings for Lua

# Documentation

Documentation can be found at [this repo's github pages](https://euclidianace.github.io/ltreesitter/)
(Which are autogenerated using a lua script that uses this library)

## WIP

This is super duper work in progress. Only works on \*nix, but should be easy enough to write a windows wrapper (if you're a windows user and you'd like to pr, search for `dlopen` and `dlclose` and make some ifdefs)

`ltreesitter` is avaliable on luarocks

```
luarocks install ltreesitter
```
or the dev version
```
luarocks install --server=https://luarocks.org/dev ltreesitter
